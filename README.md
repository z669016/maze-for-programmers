# Maze forProgrammers

This project provides classes to play with mazes. 

The ```Maze``` class allows a player to move through a maze and print the maze (showing a trail of visited
cells). The ```Direction``` class is used for navigation. The ```Cell``` class contains convenience methods
to manage the values of the cells (visited yes/no, directions which are open/closed).
